  ## Description
 
  This is a simple backend for a social media api that contains two models using mongoose. With this api, you can view, add, update, and delete users. You can also view, create, update, and delete thoughts for each user. There are also fields within these models that will track friends of the user, as well as reactions to user thoughts.

  ## Installation

  Simply clone and run `npm i` to install dependancies, then `npm run seed` if you'd like to seed the database with users. Finally, `node server` to start the server locally. Routes can be tested with another application of your choice, such as Insomnia or Postman.

  ## Usage

  > Any site that requires some of the basic functionality of a social media site.
